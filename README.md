ABSTRACT
In traditional healthcare systems, patients often face significant challenges when booking appointments with doctors. Long waiting times, inefficient scheduling, and the lack of direct communication with medical professionals contribute to patient frustration and wasted time. Additionally, managing appointments and payments through outdated methods often leads to unnecessary delays, errors, and reduced trust in the healthcare process. These issues highlight the need for a modern, streamlined approach to connecting patients with doctors.  
The "Public Healthcare System" addresses these challenges by offering a comprehensive online platform that eliminates inefficiencies in patient-doctor interactions. This system supports three user roles: normal users, doctors, and administrators. Normal users can register or log in using email-password credentials or Google authentication to book appointments with doctors during their available times, engage in direct conversations, and make secure payments for appointments. Doctors can upload posts for public awareness, manage their schedules, and confirm appointments with patients via email notifications. Administrators oversee the platform's functionality, with exclusive privileges to create accounts for doctors and ensure smooth operations.
By digitizing and optimizing the appointment process, the "Public Healthcare System" minimizes patient wait times, ensures effective communication, and enhances trust between patients and healthcare providers. Through its user-friendly design, secure payment integration, and structured appointment management, the platform revolutionizes the healthcare experience, making it more accessible, efficient, and patient-centered. This innovative solution seeks to transform the way patients and doctors connect, ensuring a seamless and reliable healthcare journey for all.
